This script reads your monitor resolution, decides whether you are using HD or DualHD resolution and sets a random wallpaper from $HOME/Pictures/Wallpaper/HD or $HOME/Pictures/Wallpaper/DualHD as your desktop background and another as lockscreen. 
There is also an adjoin-option for DualHD-resolution to take two Wallpapers from the HD-folder.

Requirements
* Screen Resolution of 1920x1080 or 3840x1080
* .png and/or .jpg files in the folder corresponding to the resolution as specified above
* For the adjoin-option: the imageMagick-library, specifically montage
